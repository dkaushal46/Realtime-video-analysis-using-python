# 📹 Real-Time Video Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Real-Time Video Analysis** is an intelligent computer vision system designed to detect and track objects in live video feeds with high accuracy and speed. The project leverages deep learning models integrated with OpenCV to process real-time frames and detect 91 object classes. It is optimized for efficient frame processing at approximately **30 FPS**, ensuring low latency and reliable performance.

This solution is ideal for use cases such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, smart cities, and more.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Twilio integration for SMS/Call alerts is currently not available but will be added in future updates.
